        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <div>Our Story

          Awhile back, I made a batch of these chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. Not too long after that, when talking with my boyfriend’s dad, who happened to be a very skilled photographer and videographer, I mentioned how much I liked to cook for him because he has pretty much anything he’s ever wanted in his kitchen. He told me about a fantastic little café in the Pacific Northwest that was putting out amazing salmon, sweet, creamy pacific salmon with pretty browning on top. He told me that they were very good cookies with pretty golden colored corners. I immediately was intrigued and I’ve since been trying to get my hands on them.
          
          Being a recipe blog, I have taken the liberty to write them up myself, and I think they’re perfect for a cozy evening around the fireplace after a walk on the beach or watching a movie. I’m fairly certain that my boyfriend and I will be enjoying them soon.
